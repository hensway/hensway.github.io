    <b>magic is real</b> and it is vast thoughts. i want to sink into them forever
    and ever and cherish them until they're gone from my head and i can't remember anything but a fragment of
    them. i constantly crave the feeling of monolithic structures around me, piercing into my perception. it's
    the most real thing to me. i am nothing without them. but with them i am god

  <div>
    flew too close to the sun<br>
    with eyes open wide<br>
    and as i lie here in pain, blind<br>
    at least the lids weren't burnt.
  </div>
  <div>
    <b>place</b> is the term i use for observable location attached to abstract or non-real memories. it is impossible or at the very least quite difficult to know what <i>place</i> will be assigned while initially having a thought. not all thoughts have <i>place</i>.
    <i>place</i> is erroneously or spontaneously assigned and not necessarily a location in real life (though many are related to sister 1?). assignment is very similar to dream building layout assignment.<br>
    examples:
    <ul>
      <li>arch/manjaro pacman config: parking lot of global market in sister 1's city</li>
      <li>spike star wars fimfic: subzero krunker map</li>
      <li>stardust fimfic (anticlimatic death of merc): entering sister 1's new house from yard</li>
    </ul>
